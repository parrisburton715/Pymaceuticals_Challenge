# Cancer Treatment Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes the effectiveness of different cancer treatment regimens using data from a preclinical study on mice. The goal is to identify the most promising treatments for further evaluation.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7
- pandas 1.3.0
- matplotlib 3.4.2
- numpy 1.21.1
- scipy 1.7.0

## Data Files
- `mouse_metadata.csv`: Contains metadata for each mouse, including ID, drug regimen, sex, age, and weight.
- `study_results.csv`: Contains results from the preclinical study, including measurements of tumor volume and metastatic sites over time.

## Data Exploration
Initial exploration of the data revealed a total of 250 mice in the study, with a variety of drug regimens being tested.

## Data Preprocessing
The data was cleaned and merged to create a single data frame containing all relevant information for analysis.

## Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed to compare the effectiveness of different treatment regimens in reducing tumor volume and metastasis. Visualizations were created to illustrate the findings.

## Results
The analysis found that certain treatment regimens, such as Capomulin and Ramicane, showed promise in reducing tumor volume compared to others. Further investigation is needed to determine the long-term effects and potential side effects of these treatments.
